  <p style="color: white"><strong>Joker</strong> is a serial killer and a super-villain, a dangerous madman who dresses
    like a clown and commits violent crimes. He is often recognized as Batman's greatest enemy, living in and
    terrorizing Gotham City,
    although he spends most of his time in Arkham Asylum. In addition to being a deadly and unpredictable physical
    combatant, he is a brilliant and ruthless criminal mastermind. His crimes require no motivation other than his
    sadistic desire to show people the
    meaninglessness of life through pain and death, and the narcissism to see the world remade in his own image. He is
    constantly adapting his personality and his psychosis to respond to the world around him, sometimes a harmless
    trickster and at others a brutal mass-murderer.
    Batman is his only worthy opponent, and although he has passed up multiple opportunities to murder the dark knight,
    he has no such problems with killing Robin or crippling Batgirl.

  <p style="color: white"><strong>Two face / Harvey dent</strong> is a super-villain obsessed with duality and the
    number "two." He is an enemy to Batman in Gotham City. In his private life he was Harvey Dent, Gotham's district
    attorney.
    The mobster Sal Maroni burned his face with a bottle of acid during trial. His psychosis leads him to believe that
    right and wrong don't matter, as everything is ruled by chance. To prove this, he makes decisions of good or evil
    based on the flip of a special coin.
    This makes him highly unpredictable as a criminal mastermind. He has been a member of the Injustice Gang and the
    Injustice League. There have been several others to use the name Two-Face including the butler Wilkins, the actor
    Paul Sloane, and the criminal George Blake.
    Two-Face was created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger, first appearing in Detective Comics #66.(1942)

  <p style="color: white"><strong>Riddler / Edward Nigma / Edward Nashton</strong> is a super-villain enemy of Batman
    who commits crimes revolving around an obsession with riddles. His mental psychosis results from a deep inner need
    to prove that he's smarter and therefore better than others,
    which causes him to leave challenging clues behind in otherwise perfect crimes. This psychological compulsion has
    resulted in him being repeatedly imprisoned in Arkham Asylum. Despite this obvious flaw, he is otherwise an
    extremely intelligent criminal mastermind. He has been associated with the Legion of Doom and the Secret Society of
    Super-Villains.
    The Riddler was created by Bill Finger and Dick Sprang, first appearing in Detective Comics #140. (1948)
